# MAMS CAS

MAMS CAS is a web app portal for students of the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI to register for courses for their senior year of school. The current implementation is a paper based system which is inefficient. This application will allow students to see available courses they can select and send course requests to teachers. Teachers will also be able to log in and review course requests submitted by students to approve or deny them. Once the review process is complete the course requests will be sent to WPI.
